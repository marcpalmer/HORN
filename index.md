title: HORN Specification and Reference Implementations
layout: home
---

The HORN specification describes a way to weave your model data into HTML markup
such that it can be used for _both_ the presentation and data model in your
client (typically JavaScript) code.

There is a jQuery based reference implementation of the parser with DOM-node
re-population for full data round trip in your UI.
