* Eliminate horn-jquery-extract, incorporate this into the end of horn-jquery.js

* Remove javadoc style comments, replace with whatever people tend to use for JS

* Document which are public methods and which are internal functions, perhaps namespace them i.e. handleTemplateValue

* Rename "components" to bindings --- binding of UI element to model.

* Rename render ===> updateDOM()

* Either stop traverse() hitting values that should not be propagated to DOM,
  or add new modelValueFilter function option, default to excluding jQuery &
  Date

Public API is just:

extract()
updateDOM()
newFromTemplate()
model()
option()
reset()
