* Eliminate horn-jquery-extract, incorporate this into the end of horn-jquery.js

* Remove javadoc style comments, replace with whatever people tend to use for JS

* Document which are public methods and which are internal functions, perhaps namespace them i.e. handleTemplateValue

* What are "components"?

* Rename HORN.render ===> HORN.updateDOM()
