HORN
=====

This is a specification for inlining model data into your HTML pages, which
can be used for the presentation of the view to the site user, as well as
being parsed out by machines - typically by JavaScript in your page to build
up the data model for your client code.

This saves duplication of data and AJAX round-trip on first page load, and
means you have SEO-friendly data in your pages.
